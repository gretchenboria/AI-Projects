1rst place of the AGI House AI Vibe Coding Hackathon 3/8/2025

TypeWho is a typing pattern analyzer using machine learning algorithms.

TypeWho comes with a browser extension that analyzes your unique typing patterns (keystroke dynamics) to verify your identity. It continuously monitors your typing, compares it to your stored profile, and provides a confidence score indicating a match. Ideal for security and ensuring the right person is at the keyboard.

Vibe coding is an AI-assisted approach where you describe your software idea in plain language and the AI writes the code for you. It's that simple, and this guide will show you how. See what vibe coding is all about: https://alitu.com/creator/workflow/what-is-vibe-coding/
